# minizinc-or-tools
Repo of Dockerfile for Docker image of MiniZinc bundled with OR-Tools Solver

Check it out and pull it at https://hub.docker.com/r/juanmarcos935/minizinc-or-tools

* It is better than official minizinc/minizinc because has additionally OR-Tools solver installed and functional, so you can run your MiniZinc models with this interesting solver too (MiniZinc official only comes with Gecode, Chuffed and Coin-BC)
